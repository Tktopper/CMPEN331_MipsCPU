# CMPEN331---Computer-Organization-and-Design-32-bit-MIPS-CPU

The purpose for these labs was to develop a 32 bit MIPS pipelined cpu. Where each lab broke the CPU into sections of the pipeline.

Lab 3 required knowledge and developement of the first two stages of the pipeline.
  -Instruction Fetch
  -Instruction Decode
  
Lab 4 built onto this, adding the next two stages of the pipeline
  -Execution
  -Memory

Then for the final lab, Lab 5 added the final stage of the pipeline
  -Writeback

Then for the final project, Forwarding was implemented to detect any hazards
As extra credit, Stalling, Jump, and Branch instructions were all implemented to 
complete a fully functioning MIPS cpu.
