# CMPEN 331 - Computer Organization and Design: 32-bit MIPS CPU Design Project

# Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files for the CMPEN 331 Computer Organization and Design project at Penn State University. 
The project involves implementing the honor option section described in Lab 5, 
focusing on the error-free generation of a bitstream through a Verilog design for a Zyboboard (XC7Z010-1CLG400C).

# Project Goals
Implement a pipeline CPU using the Xilinx design package for FPGAs, as per specifications provided in Lab 3, Lab 4, and Lab 5.
Ensure the design is synthesized, implemented, and generates a bitstream without errors.
Address control hazards and implement delayed branching to optimize the pipeline CPU performance.

# Requirements
Verilog design code for Zyboboard (XC7Z010-1CLG400C).
AMD Xilinx Vivado
Verilog Test Bench design code including the timescale 1ns/1ps directive.
Waveforms as requested in the project specifications.
Design schematics from Xilinx synthesis without any area constraints.
Snapshots of I/O Planning and floor planning.

# Extra Credit
An optional part of the project includes implementing a pipeline CPU with detailed circuits as described in previous labs. 
This includes the instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back stages,
as well as handling control hazards and delayed branching, and jump instructions.
